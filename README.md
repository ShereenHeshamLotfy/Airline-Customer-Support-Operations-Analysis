# 🎧 Airline Customer Support Operations Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer support tickets for an airline to evaluate operational efficiency and service quality. By examining ticket lifecycles (from Open to Closed), issue types, and resolution costs, I identified bottlenecks in customer service and areas for cost optimization.

## 📊 Dataset Columns Included:
* **Ticket Tracking:** Ticket ID, Status (Open/Closed), Priority.
* **Customer Info:** Name, Country, Contact Details.
* **Operational Metrics:** Issue Type, Channel (Source of complaint), Estimated Cost.
* **Timeline:** Date Opened, Date Closed (Duration Analysis).

## 🔍 Key Business Questions Addressed:
1. **Efficiency:** What is the average resolution time (SLA) for different issue types?
2. **Cost Analysis:** Which countries or issue types incur the highest estimated costs?
3. **Volume & Channels:** Which channel (Email, Phone, etc.) is most used by customers?
4. **Prioritization:** Are high-priority tickets being resolved faster than low-priority ones?

## 🛠️ Tools Used:
* **Microsoft Excel:** (Calculated Columns for "Time to Resolve", Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning).
* **Interactive Dashboard:** To track Ticket Volume, Status, and Cost per Country.
